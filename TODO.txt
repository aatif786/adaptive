0) lets beef up knowledge gaps and add drilling
--knowledge mastery goals
--knowledge gaps
--track with ids and mark complete
-- Knowledge GapsI suggest that the Orchestrator tries to address these gaps one at time. 
-- An assessment or prompt exercise can remove them but only if the LLM determines that the learner has show mastery. 
-- So every core concept or dynamic concept or prompt exercise can be targted towards one gap, 
-- then the LLM decides from that evaluation whether that gap is cleared.
1) create a capstone project to help them
0) add multiple choice to assessment
2) add debug data to UI
6) TEST ALL FLOWS
7)assessment seems to be truncated
8) fix smart replu UI
9) fix welcome message and get rid of 10 number
10) get rid of first concept
11) fix UI timeout
12) concept complete is stuck for one iteration? 
13) remaining core concept is still 10 even though there is only a few
14) turn off auto advance
15) skipping doesn't work during assessment?
16) while waiting, a concept card should be shown

------
3) add derivative data to UI
3b) display expert skills in UI
4) make prompts smarter
7) Add text to speech to UI
8) display concept author along with expert tips

0) Convert to LangChain and Fast API


SUPER LONG (not for prototype)
----------------
0) exception handling
1b) exception handling and restoring state machine
1) race conditions
2) how to retrieve content
3) store session state (consider GDPR
4) learner ability to save state and exit course 
5) ability to store insight of learner across sessions
6) LLM decision safety checks in case they make wrong decisions
7) state machine manager, should manage all transitions, and should handle exception and state fallback
8) we probably need some sort of locking to ensure that we don't corrupt the state machine
9) when flow is updated and deployed, existing sessions should not be impacted
