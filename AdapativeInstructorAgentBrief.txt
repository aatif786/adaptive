# Adaptive Instructor Agent: System Overview for Module Design

## Vision & Purpose
The Adaptive Instructor Agent is LinkedIn's next-generation learning platform that transforms passive video courses into dynamic, personalized learning experiences. It activates LinkedIn's trusted course library through an AI system that adapts in real-time to learner needs, behaviors, and goals.

## Core Architecture

### Tool-Orchestrated Instruction
The agent uses a modular toolset where each tool delivers focused instructional functions:

**For the MVP, three primary tools:**

1. **Concept Card Tool**
   - Displays concept summaries and expert tips
   - Should be 3-5 minutes of content
   - Titles can be human-curated or dynamically generated
   - Returns learner notes/questions/comments to the Adaptive Instructor

2. **Assessment Tool**
   - Presents questions after each concept card
   - Can be Multiple Choice or Formative (open-ended)
   - Assessments can be skipped by learners
   - Sends answers back to Adaptive Instructor for evaluation

3. **Prompt Refinement Tool** (Specialized for AI/Prompt courses)
   - Learner writes a prompt based on scenario
   - Tool generates/simulates AI response
   - Shows what the prompt did well
   - Provides specific improvement suggestions
   - Allows iteration (learner can refine and try again)
   - Sends prompt quality feedback to Adaptive Instructor

### Common Tool Features
- Each tool generates "smart replies" - suggested responses the learner might want to send to the instructor
- All tools can receive typed notes/questions from learners
- Every interaction is assessed by the Adaptive Instructor

## Adaptive Instructor Capabilities

### Assessment Functions
- **Concept Card responses**: Evaluates questions or comments from learners
- **Assessment answers**: Determines if answers are correct
- **Prompt quality**: Analyzes the effectiveness of prompts in the Prompt Refinement Tool

### Adaptive Flow
1. **Normal Flow**: Learner progresses through human-curated sequence
2. **Gap Detection**: If assessment reveals knowledge gap or learner asks for clarification
3. **Dynamic Intervention**: Agent immediately generates and shows a dynamic concept card to address the gap
4. **Gap Resolution**: Once gap is cleared through the dynamic content
5. **Return to Sequence**: Learner returns to the human-curated module sequence

## System Components

### Orchestrator
- Manages the client-agent interaction loop
- For MVP: Executes the expert-predefined sequence of tools and content
- Consults with Adaptive Instructor on any dynamic content needs

### Agent State & Memory
The agent maintains several layers of information:
- **Learner Profile**: Current role, company, skills
- **Progress Tracking**: Which concepts were presented, assessment results
- **Outcome Tracking**: Whether learning outcomes have been met
- **Session State**: Current position in the course, recent interactions

### Course Container
Contains the complete module definitions that are fed into the Adaptive Instructor:

**Module Structure** (exact format TBD):
- **Story Elements**: Narrative that connects modules together
- **Learning Goals**: Specific objectives for each module
- **Skills/Techniques**: What will be taught and practiced
- **Content Specifications**: Concept card content, assessments, practice scenarios
- **Sequencing Logic**: Order and dependencies between modules

**Open Questions**:
- Exact data format and schema for modules
- Level of detail (high-level goals vs. detailed scripts)
- Balance of AI-generated vs. human-authored instruction content
- How prescriptive vs. flexible the module definitions should be

## MVP Implementation Details

### Content Structure
- **Human-Curated Elements**:
  - Learning outcomes
  - Module sequence and tool selection
  - Core concept content
  - Assessment questions
  - Example flows/sequencing
  
- **AI-Generated Elements**:
  - Gap-filling concept cards when learners struggle
  - Personalized examples
  - Additional explanations
  - Dynamic assessment questions for knowledge gaps

### Sequencing for MVP
- **LinkedIn Experts predefine**: Module order, tool selection per module, content flow
- **Adaptive Instructor handles**: Detecting gaps, generating supplementary content, personalizing examples

## Domain Scalability

The platform is designed to scale across all learning domains:

### For AI/Prompt Engineering Courses
- Uses all three tools with heavy emphasis on Prompt Refinement Tool
- Focuses on iterative practice and improvement

### For Other Domains
- Primarily uses Concept Card + Assessment tools
- Prompt Refinement Tool replaced with domain-specific tools as needed
- Same underlying architecture and adaptive capabilities

## Module Design Requirements

When creating modules, consider:

1. **Concept Card Content**
   - 3-5 minutes of focused teaching
   - Clear learning objective
   - Practical examples
   - Sets up the practice exercise

2. **Tool Selection & Sequencing**
   - Which tool follows the concept card
   - How tools build on each other
   - Where learners might need alternate paths

3. **Assessment Design**
   - Questions that reveal true understanding vs memorization
   - Identifies common misconceptions
   - Provides useful signal to the Adaptive Instructor

4. **Adaptive Scenarios**
   - What gaps might emerge
   - What additional content might be needed
   - How to handle different skill levels

5. **Smart Replies**
   - Common questions learners might have
   - Typical responses to continue learning
   - Ways to ask for clarification

## Module Pattern Template
1. **Concept Card**: Introduce core concept
2. **Practice Tool**: Apply the concept (varies by domain)
3. **Assessment**: Check understanding
4. **Adaptive Support**: Dynamic concept cards if gaps detected
5. **Return to Flow**: Continue to next module

The Adaptive Instructor Agent represents a fundamental shift from static courses to dynamic, personalized learning journeys that meet each learner exactly where they are and guide them to mastery.
