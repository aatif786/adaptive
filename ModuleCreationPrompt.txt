# AI-Native PM Course Module Generation Prompt

## Context & System Requirements

You are creating modules for LinkedIn Learning's Adaptive Instructor Agent system. Each module MUST follow this exact structure:
1. **Concept Card** (3-5 min): Story-driven teaching with emotional arc
2. **Practice Tool** (3-4 min): Hands-on application using Prompt Refinement Tool
3. **Assessment** (1-2 min): Questions that verify understanding
4. **Smart Replies**: Pre-generated responses learners might need

## The Mission

Transform anxious mid-level PMs into AI-powered strategic leaders through Sarah's annual planning journey. Each module should feel like drinking from a firehose (in a good way) - learners should think "I can't believe how much I'm getting from this!"

## Module Creation Instructions

For Module [X], create the following components:

### 1. CONCEPT CARD (Follow ConceptCardInstructions.txt exactly)

**Story Requirements:**
- Continue Sarah's journey from [previous module endpoint]
- Show her facing a specific, relatable challenge
- Include real dialogue with stakeholders
- Feature an "aha moment" when she discovers the technique
- Show immediate transformation/results
- Include specific metrics/data (make it feel real)

**Teaching Requirements:**
- Introduce ONE primary technique with memorable name
- Embed 2-3 related techniques naturally in examples
- Include a clear framework (acronym or steps)
- Show before/after contrast
- Make the learner think "I NEED this for my job"

**Emotional Arc:**
- Start with specific anxiety/pain point
- Build tension with failing approach
- Create relief with new technique
- End with confidence boost
- Plant seeds of "what else is possible?"

### 2. PROMPT REFINEMENT TOOL EXERCISE

**Scenario Design (per PromptRefinementTool.txt):**
- Place learner in Sarah's exact situation
- Provide rich context and constraints
- Include [Data] placeholders with descriptions
- Make it immediately applicable to their real job

**Progressive Difficulty:**
- First attempt: Likely to make common mistakes
- Second attempt: Apply feedback, see improvement
- Third attempt: Achieve professional-level output

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- What expert PMs would check for
- Common mistakes to catch
- Signs of strategic thinking
- Technique mastery indicators

### 3. ASSESSMENT QUESTIONS

Create 2-3 questions that:
- Test conceptual understanding, not memorization
- Reveal if they can apply the technique
- Surface common misconceptions
- Connect to real PM challenges

### 4. SMART REPLIES

Generate 3 contextual responses:
- "I'm confused about [specific aspect]"
- "How does this work with [related scenario]?"
- "Can we practice this differently?"

## Value Density Requirements

Every module MUST:
- **Teach 4+ techniques** (1 primary, 3+ embedded)
- **Create 1 reusable artifact** (template, framework, checklist)
- **Save 2+ hours** of work when applied
- **Unlock 1 career advancement opportunity**
- **Build on previous modules** (callbacks, combinations)

## Sarah's Character Arc

Module should advance Sarah from:
- **Professional growth**: [Current skill] → [New capability]
- **Emotional growth**: [Current fear] → [New confidence]  
- **Career growth**: [Current perception] → [New recognition]
- **Strategic growth**: [Tactical thinking] → [Strategic thinking]

## Technique Integration Map

Primary Technique: [Name from Techniques.txt]
Embedded Techniques: [2-3 related ones that naturally fit]
Callback Techniques: [Reference 1-2 from previous modules]
Bonus Tips: [1-2 power-user variations]

## Success Metrics for Your Output

The module succeeds if a learner would:
- Immediately want to try the technique at work
- Feel they got 3x the value in half the time
- See clear path to promotion/recognition
- Tell colleagues "You HAVE to take this course"
- Feel like they have superpowers

## Output Format

Please provide:
1. Module Title & Learning Objectives
2. Complete Concept Card (with all ConceptCardInstructions.txt elements)
3. Prompt Refinement Tool Exercise (with all required components)
4. 3 Assessment Questions with correct answers
5. 3 Smart Reply options
6. Transition hook to next module

## Critical Reminders

- **Density is King**: Pack in value without overwhelming
- **Story is Queen**: Sarah's journey must feel real and urgent
- **Practical > Theoretical**: Every minute must be applicable
- **Career Impact**: Show how this changes their trajectory
- **Technique Names**: Must be memorable and professional
- **LinkedIn Appropriate**: Corporate-friendly, not startup-casual

## Example Excellence Bar

After reading your module, learners should think:
- "This is exactly what I face at work"
- "I can't believe I've been doing it the hard way"
- "I could use this tomorrow in my planning meeting"
- "My boss is going to be impressed"
- "What else can I learn in the next module?"
