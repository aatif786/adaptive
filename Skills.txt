1. Data Preparation & Context Setting

What it is: Teaching AI about YOUR specific situation before asking for help

Why they need it: Generic prompts = generic (useless) outputs

Example: Instead of "analyze customer feedback," providing company context, product details, customer segments, and success metrics first

2. Progressive Prompt Chaining

What it is: Breaking complex analyses into sequential steps

Why they need it: AI can't do deep thinking in one shot

Example: First prompt extracts data → Second finds patterns → Third identifies segments → Fourth recommends actions

3. Multi-Source Synthesis

What it is: Combining insights from different data types and sources

Why they need it: PMs deal with messy, distributed information

Example: Merging support tickets + sales calls + user analytics + competitor data into coherent insights

4. Output Validation & Fact-Checking

What it is: Knowing when AI is hallucinating or missing nuance

Why they need it: Career-ending mistakes from trusting AI blindly

Example: Spot-checking 10% of AI categorizations, verifying metrics against source data

5. Audience-Aware Translation

What it is: One insight → multiple stakeholder versions

Why they need it: Different audiences need different framing

Example: Technical findings → CEO summary, engineering details, sales talking points

6. Strategic Narrative Building

What it is: Turning data into compelling stories with AI

Why they need it: Data doesn't convince people, stories do

Example: Transform usage metrics into "here's why we're winning/losing" narrative

7. Rapid Competitive Intelligence

What it is: Using AI to monitor and analyze competitor moves

Why they need it: Markets move fast, can't manually track everything

Example: Weekly competitor feature analysis, pricing changes, positioning shifts

8. Document Multiplication

What it is: One source document → complete artifact suite

Why they need it: PMs waste hours creating variations of same content

Example: PRD → JIRA tickets, test cases, success metrics, FAQ, release notes

9. Risk & Edge Case Detection

What it is: Using AI to find what could go wrong

Why they need it: PMs are accountable when features fail

Example: "What could break this feature?" "What users would hate this?"

10. Meeting & Communication Efficiency

What it is: AI for prep, notes, follow-ups, and summaries

Why they need it: Mid-level PMs are in meetings 50% of time

Example: Pre-meeting briefs, real-time note structuring, action item extraction

Skills You Listed That Are Actually Techniques:

These are good but they're more like specific techniques within the skills above:

11. Time Estimation & Capacity Planning with AI

What it is: Using AI to predict effort and timelines

Why they need it: Mid-level PMs own delivery commitments

Example: "Based on these requirements, estimate story points and sprint allocation"

12. AI Tool Selection & Integration

What it is: Knowing which AI tool for which job

Why they need it: Not everything needs ChatGPT

Example: Claude for analysis, Perplexity for research, Notion AI for docs, etc.
