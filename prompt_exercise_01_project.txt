✅ **Prompt Mastery Scenario: Plan the Launch of a New Internal Employee Portal**

### 🧠 Prompt Task:

You are leading the launch of a new internal employee portal for your 300-person company.  
The portal will serve as a central hub for:

- HR policies  
- IT support links  
- Company announcements  
- Employee resource groups  

You have been asked to:

Prompt an AI assistant to generate a full **6-week project plan** for launching this portal, including:

- Tasks  
- Owners  
- Milestones  
- Risks  

You will be working with a cross-functional team from **HR, IT, and Communications**.  
You **cannot hire additional help**. The **deadline is fixed**, and executive stakeholders expect a **smooth, polished rollout**.

*You’ll create and refine your prompt until the output is something you’d confidently present to leadership.*

## 🧠 Concept Card: Crafting High-Impact Prompts for Project Plans

### Scenario
You're leading the **launch of an internal employee portal** for a 300-person company. The portal will include HR documents, IT support links, and company announcements. You're working with HR, IT, and Comms teams, and need a **6-week project plan** from an AI assistant.

But: 
- You have **no extra hiring capacity**
- The **timeline is fixed**
- Stakeholders expect a **risk-mitigated, role-assigned plan**
- The final output must be **clear, presentable, and executive-ready**

### Why Strong Prompting Matters
AI-generated project plans are only as good as your prompt. If your prompt is vague, you’ll get:
- Generic tasks
- No task ownership
- No risk planning
- No clear structure

Great prompts make your AI assistant feel like a seasoned project manager. They reflect real-world constraints, multiple teams, and presentable output formats.

### Techniques You’ll Practice
| Technique               | What It Looks Like in This Task                           |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Context Framing**     | "You are a professional internal project planner..."       |
| **Constraint Injection**| "No new hires; timeline is fixed"                          |
| **Decomposition**       | Include HR, IT, and Comms tasks                            |
| **Structural Instruction**| "Return the output as a markdown table with columns..." |
| **Prompt Iteration**    | Improve prompt until risks, owners, and milestones appear  |

### Expert Tip 💡
A strong prompt often reads like a well-written project brief.

------------------------
Criterion #	Prompt Requirement	Prompting Technique Taught
1	Frame the AI’s role (e.g., “You are a professional internal project planner…”)	Context Framing
2	Mention all stakeholders: HR, IT, Comms, Executives	Decomposition / Coverage
3	Include known constraints (6-week deadline, no new hires, internal use only)	Constraint Injection
4	Ask for milestone-based breakdown (weekly or phase-based)	Structural Instruction
5	Include risk planning and mitigation for key functions	Prompt Depth / Stress Testing
6	Ask for ownership assignment by role or function	Prompt Refinement & Realism
7 (bonus)	Specify format: return as markdown table with columns: Week, Task, Owner, Notes	Format Control / Clarity



🔍 The Missing Layer: Strategic Prompting + Evaluation
Here's what’s currently missing:

    Prompt Strategy: How do you prompt AI effectively to uncover risks that aren’t obvious?

    Evaluation Skills: How do you critically assess the AI’s risk suggestions and improve them?

    Iteration & Framing: How do you frame follow-up prompts to improve depth, specificity, and actionability?




🧠 High-Level Workflow: AI-Accelerated Project Planning
✅ 1. Frame the Objective for the AI

    “What are we asking the AI to help with?”

    Define the goal clearly: Launch an in-app onboarding experience for enterprise users in 8 weeks.

    List constraints: Time (8 weeks), team composition, no extra hiring, tight budget.

    Specify expected output format: Tasks, milestones, timeline, owners.

Prompt Example:

    “You are a senior product manager. Generate a detailed 8-week project plan to launch an in-app onboarding experience for enterprise customers. Assume collaboration across product, design, eng, legal, and support. Include weekly milestones and key dependencies.”

🔍 2. Decompose the Scope with AI

    “Break it down: what does this project involve?”

    Ask AI to suggest core workstreams: e.g., design, backend, frontend, content, QA, compliance.

    Ask follow-ups to clarify hidden steps (e.g., “what are common legal blockers in onboarding flows?”)

    Use this to uncover tasks you may have missed.

🧩 3. Define and Sequence Milestones

    “What has to happen by when?”

    Use AI to create weekly or phase-based milestones.

    Ask AI to reason about dependencies: “Can content writing and frontend happen in parallel?”

    Refine to avoid bottlenecks.

📈 4. Allocate Resources and Ownership

    “Who does what?”

    Ask AI to suggest task owners by function.

    If the org structure is known, prompt with roles: PM, 1 designer, 3 engineers, 1 QA, 1 legal POC.

    Consider handoffs, approvals, and decision gates.

🚨 5. Risk Identification + Mitigation

    “What could go wrong?”

    Prompt AI to surface top 5 risks given the constraints.

    Ask for mitigation strategies or backup plans.

    Optionally, simulate: “What happens if the legal review slips by 1 week?”

🔁 6. Iterate for Realism

    “Is this plan actually doable?”

    Ask AI to simplify or compress: “Can we do this in 6 weeks if needed?”

    Or expand: “Add buffer weeks and pre-mortem tasks.”

    Compare AI-generated plans to past examples for calibration.

📝 7. Finalize & Format

    “How do I package this for others?”

    Ask AI to convert into:

        Markdown checklist

        Gantt-style breakdown

        Table with task/owner/week

        Shareable doc or Slack-ready summary
