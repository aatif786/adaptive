The portal will include HR documents, IT support links, and company announcements. You're working with HR, IT, and Comms teams, and need a **6-week project plan** from an AI assistant.\n\nBut: \n- You have **no extra hiring capacity**\n- The **timeline is fixed**\n- Stakeholders expect a **risk-mitigated, role-assigned plan**\n- The final output must be **clear, presentable, and executive-ready**\n\n### Why Strong Prompting Matters\nAI-generated project plans are only as good as your prompt. If your prompt is vague, you‚Äôll get:\n- Generic tasks\n- No task ownership\n- No risk planning\n- No clear structure\n\nGreat prompts make your AI assistant feel like a seasoned project manager. They reflect real-world constraints, multiple teams, and presentable output formats.\n\n### Techniques You‚Äôll Practice\n| Technique               | What It Looks Like in This Task                           |\n|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Context Framing**     | \"You are a professional internal project planner...\"       |\n| **Constraint Injection**| \"No new hires; timeline is fixed\"                          |\n| **Decomposition**       | Include HR, IT, and Comms tasks                            |\n| **Structural Instruction**| \"Return the output as a markdown table with columns...\" |\n| **Prompt Iteration**    | Improve prompt until risks, owners, and milestones appear  |",

      "summary": "Prompt engineering is the skill of writing clear, structured inputs that guide AI tools to produce high-quality, relevant outputs. It‚Äôs not just about asking a question‚Äîit‚Äôs about communicating with precision, providing context, and defining the role, tone, or format you want. This module helps project managers master this foundational skill so they can make AI tools like ChatGPT work for them across a range of tasks. Good prompting starts by defining the outcome: Are you asking for a summary, a message, a task list, or a risk forecast? Then, you refine the input by adding necessary context‚Äîwhat project, what audience, what constraints. Including tone, format (like bullet points or CSV), and role (e.g., 'you are a project coordinator') helps tailor results. This level of clarity minimizes ambiguity and reduces the need for follow-up corrections. Learners will also explore techniques like using delimiters for structured inputs, applying personas, and iterating based on AI outputs. The goal is to reduce guesswork and enable precise, repeatable results‚Äîwhether drafting communications, outlining plans, or analyzing decisions. Prompting is a superpower for modern PMs: it lets you turn AI into a strategic assistant. This skill transforms vague requests into clear, actionable outputs that can immediately feed into your project tools and workflows.",
