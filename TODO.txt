3) add derivative data to UI
3b) display expert skills in UI
4) make prompts smarter
7) Add text to speech to UI
8) display concept author along with expert tips
9) Knowledge GapsI suggest that the Orchestrator tries to address these gaps one at time. An assessment or prompt exercise can remove them but only if the LLM determines that the learner has show mastery. So every core concept or dynamic concept or prompt exercise can be targted towards one gap, then the LLM decides from that evaluation whether that gap is cleared.


LONG
-------
0) Convert to LangChain and Fast API


SUPER LONG (not for prototype)

3) store session state (consider GDPR
4) learner ability to save state and exit course 
5) ability to store insight of learner across sessions
6) LLM decision safety checks in case they make wrong decisions
7) state machine manager, should manage all transitions, and should handle exception and state fallback
