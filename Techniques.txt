Complete Techniques Catalog for the Course
Data Preparation & Context Setting Techniques

"The Context Sandwich"

Company context → specific ask → output format
Example: "We're a B2B SaaS with 50K users... Analyze this data... Format as executive summary"


"Chunking & Batching"

Break large datasets into 50-100 item batches
Maintain consistent schema across chunks


"The Schema First Method"

Define extraction structure before analysis
Example: "Extract: issue_type, severity, customer_segment, requested_feature"


"Role Playing Prompt"

"Act as a senior data analyst at a SaaS company..."
Gives AI professional context



Progressive Prompt Chaining Techniques

"Russian Doll Prompting"

Start broad → narrow → specific → actionable
Each prompt builds on previous output


"The Five Whys Chain"

Keep asking why to get to root causes
Example: Low adoption → Why? → Poor onboarding → Why? → Complex setup


"Zoom In/Zoom Out"

Alternate between high-level and detailed views
Prevents missing forest for trees


"The Validation Loop"

Analyze → Validate sample → Refine → Re-analyze
Builds confidence in results



Multi-Source Synthesis Techniques

"The Triangle Method"

Always combine 3 sources for any conclusion
Example: Customer feedback + usage data + support tickets


"Source Tagging System"

[QUAL] for qualitative, [QUANT] for quantitative
Helps AI weight evidence appropriately


"The Mosaic Technique"

Piece together partial information from multiple sources
"What pattern emerges from these fragments?"



Output Validation Techniques

"The 10% Spot Check"

Manually verify 10% of any AI categorization
If >20% errors, refine and rerun


"Red Flag Scanning"

Look for: absolute statements, made-up metrics, timeline impossibilities
Common AI hallucination patterns


"Cross-Reference Verification"

"Does this match our dashboard?"
"Is this consistent with last quarter?"


"The Sanity Check Prompt"

"Review this analysis. What seems questionable or needs verification?"



Audience-Aware Translation Techniques

"The Persona Prompt"

Include stakeholder details: "Jim cares about technical feasibility and hates surprises"
AI adapts tone and content


"The Pyramid Principle"

Conclusion first → supporting points → details
Perfect for executive communication


"The SCQA Framework"

Situation → Complication → Question → Answer
Creates compelling narrative flow



Strategic Narrative Building Techniques

"The Story Spine"

Once upon a time... Every day... Until one day... Because of that...
Turns data into memorable stories


"The So What Test"

After each insight: "So what? Why should they care?"
Ensures relevance


"Before/After Snapshots"

Paint vivid picture of current vs. future state
Makes abstract concrete



Competitive Intelligence Techniques

"The Feature Matrix Method"

Create structured comparison grids
"Extract features from these competitor pages into a standardized table"


"Gap Analysis Prompting"

"What do they have that we don't?"
"What do customers praise them for?"


"The Trend Spotter"

"Analyze these 5 competitors. What pattern are they all following?"



Document Multiplication Techniques

"The Cascade Method"

PRD → Epics → Stories → Tasks
Each level generated from the previous


"The RACI Generator"

From project plan → who's Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed


"Format Switching"

"Convert this technical spec into: 1) FAQ 2) Training guide 3) Sales enablement"



Risk & Edge Case Detection Techniques

"The Pre-Mortem Prompt"

"Assume this project failed spectacularly. What went wrong?"
Surfaces hidden risks


"Edge Case Enumeration"

"List 20 ways users could misuse this feature"
"What happens if [unexpected scenario]?"


"The Devil's Advocate"

"Argue against this approach. What are the strongest objections?"



Meeting & Communication Efficiency Techniques

"The Pre-Read Generator"

"Create a 1-page brief covering context, decision needed, and options"


"Action Item Extraction"

"From these notes, extract WHO does WHAT by WHEN"


"The Update Transformer"

One update → Slack message, email, JIRA comment



Time Estimation & Capacity Planning Techniques

"Historical Analogy Method"

"We built X in Y time. This is similar but with Z differences. Estimate effort."


"Task Decomposition"

Break down until each task is 1-2 days
Sum up with buffer calculations


"The Uncertainty Ladder"

Rate each estimate: High/Medium/Low confidence
Apply different buffers accordingly



AI Tool Selection Techniques

"The Tool Matrix"

Task type × Tool strength = Best choice
When to use Claude vs. GPT vs. Perplexity


"The Integration Stack"

Connect AI tools: Notion AI → Claude → Slack bot
Automation possibilities



Advanced Combination Techniques

"The Second Brain System"

Feed all decisions, docs, learnings to AI
"What did we decide about X three months ago?"


"The Daily Digest"

Morning: "From yesterday's Slack, emails, and tickets, what needs my attention?"
