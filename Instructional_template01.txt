Primary Target: The Anxious Mid-Level PM
Who they are:

3-7 years experience
At mid-size to large companies (not startups)
Already successful but feeling left behind
Seeing "AI" in every job posting
Watching younger PMs use AI tools they don't understand

Why LinkedIn Learning:

They want credible, professional development
Need something their manager will approve
Want to learn without looking incompetent
Trust LinkedIn's brand for career advancement

The BEST Super Use Case for This Audience:
"The Annual Planning Season"
The Scenario: It's October. You need to present your 2025 product strategy and roadmap to leadership by November 15th. You have mountains of data but no time to analyze it all.
Why This is PERFECT for LinkedIn Learning:

Universal Corporate Experience - Every PM at established companies does this
Immediate Application - They can literally use this next month
Safe to Practice - Planning isn't as scary as fixing failures
Shows Clear ROI - "I did planning in 2 weeks instead of 6"
Career Advancing - Great planning docs get you promoted

What Makes It LinkedIn-Appropriate:

Professional, not startup-y - Appeals to corporate PMs
Strategic, not just tactical - Shows thought leadership
Collaborative - Involves stakeholders (very LinkedIn)
Data-driven - Looks good on performance reviews

Example: PRD → JIRA tickets, test cases, success metrics, FAQ, release notes
9. Risk & Edge Case Detection
What it is: Using AI to find what could go wrong
Why they need it: PMs are accountable when features fail

Why they need it: Mid-level PMs are in meetings 50% of time
Example: Pre-meeting briefs, real-time note structuring, action item extraction
Skills You Listed That Are Actually Techniques:
These are good but they're more like specific techniques within the skills above:
11. Time Estimation & Capacity Planning with AI
What it is: Using AI to predict effort and timelines
Why they need it: Mid-level PMs own delivery commitments
Example: "Based on these requirements, estimate story points and sprint allocation"
12. AI Tool Selection & Integration
