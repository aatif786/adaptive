# Priority Skills Analysis & Module Optimization Strategy

## Top Priority Skills (MUST HAVE)

### 1. Context Setting & Preparation (Foundation of Everything)
**Why Critical:** Without this, every other skill produces generic garbage
**Time to Teach:** Can be compressed to 8 minutes
**Techniques to Bundle:** 
- Context document creation
- Company/product/customer framework
- Reusable context templates

### 2. Progressive Prompt Chaining (The Multiplier)
**Why Critical:** This is how PMs think - step by step analysis
**Time to Teach:** 8 minutes minimum
**Techniques to Bundle:**
- EXTRACT → ANALYZE → SYNTHESIZE → RECOMMEND
- Chain debugging (when it breaks)
- Template chains for common PM tasks

### 3. Multi-Source Synthesis (The Reality Check)
**Why Critical:** PMs always deal with conflicting data
**Time to Teach:** Can compress to 7 minutes
**Techniques to Bundle:**
- Triangulation method
- Confidence scoring
- Source weighting

### 4. Output Validation (The Career Saver)
**Why Critical:** One bad insight in front of execs = career damage
**Time to Teach:** Can be 5 minutes if focused
**Techniques to Bundle:**
- 10% spot-check method
- Hallucination detection
- Quick verification protocols

### 5. Strategic Narrative Building (The Promoter)
**Why Critical:** This is what gets PMs promoted - turning data into decisions
**Time to Teach:** 8 minutes minimum
**Techniques to Bundle:**
- Story spine method
- Data-to-insight-to-action framework
- Executive summary generator

## High-Value Skills We Can Embed

### 6. Document Multiplication
**Smart Integration:** Teach this AS PART OF other modules
- Module 2: Show how chains create multiple outputs
- Module 5: Each narrative automatically generates artifacts
- Module 8: Dedicated 5 minutes to advanced multiplication

### 7. Competitive Intelligence  
**Smart Integration:** Weave throughout as examples
- Module 1: Include competitors in context doc
- Module 3: Use competitor data as one source
- Module 7: Quick 5-minute focused technique

### 8. Risk Detection
**Smart Integration:** Build into validation
- Module 4: Validation includes risk checking
- Module 9: Dedicated pre-mortem module

## Skills to Merge or Sacrifice

### Meeting Efficiency
**Decision:** Merge into Module 10 as part of "system"
**Rationale:** Less strategic, more tactical

### Time Estimation
**Decision:** Quick mention in Module 2 chains
**Rationale:** Important but not transformative

### Tool Selection
**Decision:** Weave throughout, not dedicated module
**Rationale:** They'll figure this out with practice

## Cramming Strategy: Technique Layering

### Layer 1: Core Teaching (40% of time)
- The main skill with deep practice

### Layer 2: Embedded Techniques (30% of time)
- Related techniques shown in examples
- "By the way, you can also..."

### Layer 3: Quick Tips (20% of time)
- Rapid-fire advanced variations
- "Power users do this..."

### Layer 4: Reference Materials (10% of time)
- Downloadable templates
- Technique cheat sheets

## Maximum Impact Approach

### Total Techniques Across Course: 40+
- 5 Core Skills (deeply taught)
- 15 Primary Techniques (practiced)
- 20+ Secondary Techniques (demonstrated)

### Delivery Optimization:
1. **Front-load Value:** Modules 1-3 contain 40% of total techniques
2. **Build Complexity:** Each module references previous techniques
3. **Create Combinations:** Show how techniques work together
4. **Sarah Discovers:** Let Sarah "accidentally" find bonus techniques

### The "Aha" Progression:
- Module 1-3: "I can do this!"
- Module 4-6: "I'm thinking differently"
- Module 7-9: "I'm faster than my senior peers"
- Module 10: "I have superpowers"

## What This Achieves

**For the Anxious PM:**
- Immediate confidence boost (Module 1)
- Visible productivity gains (Module 2-3)
- Strategic thinking upgrade (Module 4-6)
- Career acceleration tools (Module 7-10)

**Learning Efficiency:**
- 100 minutes = 40+ techniques
- Average: New technique every 2.5 minutes
- But delivered through story, not fire hose

**The Promise Delivered:**
"Transform from AI-anxious to AI-powered PM in under 2 hours"
→ They'll have 5 core skills + 35 techniques + integrated system
