## Question 3: Practical Application (Open-Ended)

**Sarah's colleague asks: "My AI keeps giving me generic advice about 'focusing on customer satisfaction' when I ask about our churn problem. What am I doing wrong?"**

**Write a brief response explaining what's likely missing and how to fix it.**

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Identifies lack of specific context as the issue
- Mentions need for company metrics/data
- Suggests using the Context Sandwich™ framework
- Provides at least one specific example

**Sample Strong Answer:**
"You're getting generic responses because AI doesn't know anything specific about your company. Try adding context first: 'We're a B2B SaaS with 10K users, 4% monthly churn (industry average 2.5%), mainly losing customers after month 3...' Then ask specifically what you want: 'Analyze why customers churn at month 3 and suggest retention strategies.' Finally, specify the format: 'Provide 3 actionable recommendations with implementation steps.' This Context Sandwich approach transforms generic AI into your strategic advisor."

## Question 4: Advanced Technique (Multiple Choice)

**When analyzing 3,000 pieces of customer feedback, what technique did Sarah use to make the task manageable?**

A) She asked AI to summarize everything in one prompt
B) She used the Chunking Strategy with 100-item batches
C) She only analyzed the negative feedback
D) She delegated it to her team

**Correct Answer:** B
**Explanation:** The Chunking Strategy breaks large datasets into manageable 100-item batches while maintaining consistent analysis schema.

## Question 5: Strategic Impact (Open-Ended)

**Your VP sees your AI-powered analysis and says: "This is incredibly strategic. How did you do this so quickly?"**

**Explain in 2-3 sentences how the Context Sandwich™ framework accelerated your analysis while improving quality.**

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Mentions time savings from structured approach
- Notes reusability of context
- Highlights strategic depth from proper context
- Shows understanding of transformation from tactical to strategic

**Sample Strong Answer:**
"The Context Sandwich™ framework let me transform weeks of analysis into hours by giving AI the full picture upfront—our metrics, challenges, and goals—so it could think strategically, not generically. Once I created my Context Master Document, I could reuse it for every analysis, making each subsequent prompt faster and more insightful. Instead of getting Wikipedia-style responses, I got boardroom-ready insights because the AI understood our specific situation and what leadership needed to see."

## Success Transition

**Upon passing (4/5 correct):**

"Outstanding! You've mastered the Context Sandwich™ framework—the foundation of AI-powered product management. You understand how to transform generic AI into a strategic partner through structured context.

But here's the thing: Sarah's about to discover that even perfect context isn't enough for complex analyses. Some problems are too big for a single prompt...

Ready to learn how to chain prompts together for exponentially more powerful insights? Module 2 awaits!"
