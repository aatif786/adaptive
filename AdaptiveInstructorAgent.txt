Project Name: LinkedIn Adaptive Instructor Agent

Vision:
The future of professional learning demands more than passive video courses or static content. Today’s professionals expect instruction that is timely, contextual, and in the flow of their work. The Adaptive Instructor Agent redefines how LinkedIn delivers learning—activating our trusted course library through a dynamic AI system that adapts in real-time to learner needs, behaviors, and goals.

Core Capabilities:

    Adaptive Learning Engine:
    Continuously assesses learner behavior, performance, and engagement to dynamically adjust pacing, modality, and instructional choices.

    Tool-Orchestrated Instruction:
    Powered by a modular toolset (e.g., Scenario Challenges, Smart Quizzes, Reflection Prompts), each tool delivers focused instructional functions and can be sequenced, layered, or invoked based on learner context.

    Outcome-Centered Framework:
    Every session is anchored in a structured outcome—defined by real-world relevance, clear milestones, and tool-fulfillable checkpoints. Outcomes can be system-suggested, learner-selected, or enterprise-assigned.

    Memory-Aware Personalization:
    The agent retains session state and learning memory across time, enabling personalized nudges, progress recall, and learner-specific next-step recommendations.

    Expert Content Activation:
    Leverages high-quality LinkedIn Learning videos, transcripts, and assessments to extract structured derivative data that powers instructional tool use. All content is transparently attributed back to original instructors.

    Enterprise Integration:
    Enterprises can inject their own training content, which the agent converts into structured outcomes and tool-based instruction—enabling scalable internal learning without authoring overhead.

    Cross-Agent Collaboration:
    Designed to connect with other intelligent agents (e.g., Microsoft Copilot, LinkedIn Career Coach), the Instructor Agent can surface learning in the flow of work, within Outlook, Teams, or LinkedIn profile journeys.

    Multi-Modal Delivery:
    Supports learning via text, voice, video, and interactive formats—tailoring delivery to each learner’s style, device, and situation.

    Localization-Ready:
    Culturally adaptive and translation-aware from the ground up, ensuring relevance and accessibility across global markets.

Technical Architecture Highlights:

    Three-tier Tool Framework:
    Supports built-in tools (LLM-native), internal integrations (e.g., Code Challenge), and external tools (via Open Protocols).

    Outcome & Goal Objects:
    Sessions are technically bound to structured outcome objects with metadata defining milestones, applicable tools, and assessment logic. Outcomes can be chained into adaptive learning pathways.

    Memory Layers:
    Learner memory is structured into session-level, topic-level, and long-term tiers, supporting persistent personalization across time and context.

    Orchestration Engine:
    Instruction is dynamically assembled in real-time—not through fixed paths, but via orchestration logic that selects tools, prompts, and instructional assets based on current learner signals.

    Derivative Data Pipeline:
    Converts course content into modular learning assets (objectives, skills, misconceptions, Q&A) for use across instructional tools.

    Open Context Protocol:
    Enables seamless integration with external agents and content surfaces using standardized input/output formats, ensuring the agent is context-aware wherever it is triggered.

Why It Matters:

This system transforms learning from a passive consumption model into an active, contextual experience grounded in real career outcomes. It ensures every learner—from beginner to expert—receives just the right challenge, instruction, and support. It also allows enterprises to scale training without building content from scratch, while respecting provenance, preserving instructor attribution, and aligning learning with global labor trends.

By building this project, we lay the foundation for a scalable, intelligent instructional engine that can power every learning surface at LinkedIn—and beyond.

Here are my requirements :

<

Here are some tools the agent has:

Concept Card Tool
Display concept summary and expert times. Should be betwee 3-5 minutes.
The concept title presented in this tool could be human curated or can be generated dynamically by the Adaptive Instructor

Assessment Tool
After each concept card, the asessment tool presents the learner with an question to asses whether they understood the concept
The assessments can be skipped

Prompt Excercise Tool
This tool simulates interactions with an AI model. The learner inputs a prompt, the tool generates (or simulates an AI response) that is shown to the user
This is also sent back as feedback

Common Tool Features
Each tool generates smart replies to the instructor as the learer submits thier response
e.g. an answer to a question from assessment tool, the next concept button for concept card, or the submit button on the prompt tool
This could be hand typed by the user as notes for the Adaptive Instructor

Adaptive Instructor
Each interaction with the learner needs to be assessed.
Concept Card Tool: The concept card may come back with a note from the learner. This could be a question or a comment
Assessment Tool: Assess the answer from the learner to see if it is correct
Prompt Excercise Tool: The quality of the prompt

The adaptive instructor decides the Depending on the feedback from the user, or any gap in understanding gleaned bu the Adaptive Instructor.
If the learner has a command on the subject, the adaptive instructor just continues with the human curated concepts.
If the learner has a gap of understanding or asks for further clarification, the adaptive instructor has to generate the concept on the fly along with an associated assessment


Orchestrator
The orchestrator manages the client agent loop.
It consults with the adaptive instructor on the next tool to be chosen along with this content

Agent State
The agent should know information about the learner such as current role, company, and skills
It should know what concepts were already presented and what the result of each assessment was
The agent should know the outcomes and whether those outcomes have been met

Course Container
This conatiner will contain the concept data for the topic
This includes concept summaries, expert tips, question and answers
The data in this container will be fetched by the agent to hydrate the concept, and assessment tools
